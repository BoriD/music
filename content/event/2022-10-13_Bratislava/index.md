We would like to present an open invitation for a collaboration to help the Slovak government, the natonal assembly, and various civil and business societies to build and monitor evidence-based policies based on the experience of the music sector. We will use the Open Policy Analysis Guideliens and the best European evidence-based policy design practice that faciliate the creation and use of transparent evidence in the entire policy cycle from design to ex post evalutation.

In the context of the OpenMuse project within the Horizon Europe framework program we would like to build on the results of the [Slovak Music Industry Report](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/) and the [Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia & Abroad](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/listen_local_2020/) and show how modern open source statistical software and data science can help the slovak music industry, and more generally, the Cultural and Creative Sectors and Industries (CCSI).

In the 2023-2025 period we would like to develop at least two ‘[smart policy documents](https://reprex.nl/apps/smart-policy-documents/)’ and accompanying live dashboards to present all available data and textual evidence. 
- [x] The Smart Policy Document template for `Music economy`, with an emphasis on increasing the value added and employment of Slovak music sector.
- [x] The Smart Policy Document template for `Music diversity and circulation`, with an emphasis on monitoring the music’s national market share in radio, streaming, educations.

**Agenda**:

- [Mária Kmety Barteková, PhD](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/authors/maria_bartekova/) will present our Consortium’s ideas on designing policy and key business indicators that fit into the Slovak national creative and cultural sectors and industries policy agenda, and organize the data collection, processing, reporting, evaluation and feedback loop in practice.
- [Daniel Antal, CFA](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/authors/daniel_antal/), the author of the [Slovak Music Industry Report](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/), will explain how our building Music and CCSI Data Observatories can help the synchronization of busienss and policy knowledge of the Slovak institutions with global knowledge hubs such as streaming platforms, industry databases, Wikipedia/Dbpedia/Freedb, Music brains, and national libraries.
