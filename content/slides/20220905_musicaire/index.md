# Music Eviota

## Surveyharmonies

Surveyharmonies is a project of SINUS, and lead by the Coordinator of OpenMuse. 

---

## Listen Local Lithuania

Listen Local Lithuania is a project of MXF, and will be shown as a use case in OpenMuse. We hope that this project can be scaled up in the future to a pan-European project of its own.

---

## Music Export Ukraine

We will further develop the [existing databases](https://www.musicexportukraine.com/database-industry-ua) of Music Export Ukraine in the OpenMuse project. Their MusicAIRE project is not related to the OpenMuse.

## Eviota

- Eviota is a project of [Reprex](https://reprex.nl/), and lead by the policy liaison officer of OpenMuse. 
- Reprex is also contesting **The Hague Innovation Award** with the support of Europeana. We want to win the support of our beautiful host city and Europe's digital cultural heritage organization to support a better connection of our projects. 
- The Hague is the winner of the [World Smart City Award](https://thehague.com/businessagency/the-hague-the-winner-world-smart-city-award-2021#:~:text=LivingLab%20Scheveningen%20is%20the%20winner%20of%20the%20international%20World%20Smart%20City%20Award), and particularly supports startups that want to have an impact of on the UN SDG Goals.  This is what we do with Eviota.

## Eviota

- Eviota is an application concept that connects financial reports with sustainability reports.
- The concept is developed with a value bank, a big four auditor, and a central bank.
- It is based on the open source software maintained by Reprex, [iotables](https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/), which has been used in the past for economic impact assessments in the Slovak and Czech music industries, and the Hungarian film industry, and which was extended for Environmental Impact Assessments.

---
## Eviota

- Eviota aims to help large companies and banks to comply with the Sustainable Finance Package, and support the European Green Deal with auditable carbon financing measurements.
- With the help of MusicAire, we will create a music industry and microenterprise friendly version of Eviota.
- The aim of this application is to make green loans, green insurance, and some green grants available for the music industry in the future.

## Eviota 
- Our challenge is simplification.  The Sustainable Finance Package is designed for the largest corporations in Europe. 
- Almost every single music entity in Europe has `simplified financial reports` which are `not audited`. 
- Our aim is the creation of an application that creates `simplified, connected sustainability reports` that may or may not be audited.
- We plan to prototype in Belgium, Czechia, Bulgaria and Malta.
- We want to make sure that we can work with many types of accounting software, and in many national (financial) reporting languages.

## Invitation for an open collaboration

[Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) | [Eviota]() |[Listen Local Lithuania](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/talk/listen-local/) | [Surveyharmonies]()

---

## Digital Music Observatory

- The Digital Music Observatory is an [Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/), which supports various public benefit music sector projects with open-source software, open data, and linked data services.

- The Digital Music Observatory was invited to make a grant agreement with the Horizon Europe Program with the [OpenMuse project](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/project/openmuse/), where four MusicAIRE beneficiaries are partners.

---

<!---
-  OpenMuse is not a competing with the MusicAIRE projects. In fact, we invited IMPALA and EMC into the OpenMuse as external partners, and our collaboration is open for others, too.

- OpenMuse will deliver a [Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/), which will be an intended prototype for a future `European Music Observatory`.

- Several MusicAIRE projects will use this open infrastructure for improving our linking their data. We offer this to any further projects which have a strong, open, and linkable data component.
