# Why Slovak Artists Are Invisible in SLovakia?

--- 

## Why They Recommend American Music

- Is the algorithm cheating? ➡️ trustworthy AI policy, enabling courts, competition and consuerm protection agencies to protect the Lithuanian CCIs
- Is the algorithm learning from bad data? ➡️  national heritage policy, consolidate Lithuanian CCI data as linked, open data, and synch it daily with the world.
- Can we ask for 20% Lithuanian music in radio, television, YouTube or Spotify?

## Data biases

- The data about the Lithuanian national cultural output and heritage shoulld be availabe in Lithuania
- Should be daily synchronized with the world via the Europena, Dbpedia, MusicBrainz and other open linked data solutions that connect YouTube, Spotify, and other platforms to daily, up-to-date knowledge to train their algorithms.
- AI is machine learning
